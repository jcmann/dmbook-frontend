# DMBook

This repository is (unsurprisingly) the frontend for my Fall 2021 Enterprise Java individual project.

It is definitely not complete currently, nor does it hook up to the API yet. This is still working with mock data.

## To Use

After cloning to your local machine run the following commands from the repository's folder.

```
npm install
npm start
```
